# MyKNN

This was a simple project that aimed to implement the K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm in Java to manage data that had either Numerical or Categorical Input attributes and only Numerical Output Attributes. This project also makes use of [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) to evaluate the algorithm's performance with a training set using parameters such as Mean Absolute Error, Relative Absolute Error and Correlation Coefficients. The report outlines the result returned from the evaluation of the algorithm along with an explanation of each of the methods used in the algorithm.


## Built With

* [Java 8] - Base Language.
* [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) - Algorithm performance evaluation and training.
